A discord Music Bot that mimics Rythm

Just a quick and simple music bot, much like Rythm, to be used in a discord server. Does require FFMPEG to be installed on your machine to run. 

Controls: 
  ?join: joins the voice channel you are currently in
  ?play: Stops whatever song is currently playing and begins playing the one you requested
    ex: ?play https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
  ?pause: Pauses the current song playing
  ?resume: Resumes the currently paused song
  ?disconnect: disconnects from the voice channel
